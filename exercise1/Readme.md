## Compilation
The Makefile takes care of the compilation.

## Contents

- `Makefile` used to compile the code.  
- `main.c` contains the main. Reads arguments and calls one of the modes.
- `src/` source directory. The C code is stored here.  
- `include/` headers directory. To include if you decide to compile manually.  
- `obj/` objects directory. The makefile will store here the objects file, to link them in the final step.  
- `snaps/` directory where the snapshots are stored.
