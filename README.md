# Final Assignement FHPC course 2022/2023

## Exercise 1
The objective of this exercise is to is to carry out a hybrid implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, utilizing both OpenMP and MPI for parallelization.

## Exercise 2
The objective of this exercise is to measure MPI point to point performance (in term of latency and bandwidth) on different types of nodes in ORFEO: EPYC, THIN and DGX. This is done in order to benchmark the results against the theoretical behaviour and performances of the nodes and their interconnections, with particular focus on the DGX.
